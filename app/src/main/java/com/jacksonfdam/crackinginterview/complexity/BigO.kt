/**
 * Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity
 * of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be
 * used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk)
 * by an algorithm.
 *
 * With Big O Notation we express the runtime in terms of :
 *
 * 1 - HOW QUICKLY THE RUNTIME GROWS —
 *  Being that it is difficult to determine the exact runtime of an algorithm.
 * It depends on the speed of the computer processor. So instead of talking about
 * the runtime directly, we use Big O Notation to talk about how quickly the runtime grows.
 *
 * 2 - RELATIVE TO THE INPUT —
 *  If we were measuring our runtime directly, we could express our speed in seconds and minutes.
 * Since we are measuring how quickly our runtime grows, we need to express our speed in terms
 * of something else. With Big O Notation, we use the size of the input, which we call “n”.
 * So we can say things like the runtime grows “on the order of the size of the input” (O(n))
 * or “on the order of the square of the size of the input” (O(n²)).
 *
 * 3 - AS THE INPUT GETS LARGER —
 *  Our algorithm may have steps that seem expensive when n is small but are eclipsed eventually
 * by other steps as n gets larger. For Big O Notation analysis, we care more about the stuff
 * that grows fastest as the input grows, because everything else is quickly eclipsed as n
 * gets very large.
